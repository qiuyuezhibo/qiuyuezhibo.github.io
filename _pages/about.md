# 🔥 About me

Welcome to my personal page! 

My name is Zhibo Zhang (张志博), a Phd student at [University of New South Wales, Canberra](https://www.unsw.edu.au/canberra), [School of Systems & Computing](https://www.unsw.edu.au/canberra/about-us/our-schools/school-of-systems-and-computing). My supervisors are [Prof. Jiankun Hu](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-jiankun-hu) and [Prof. Hemanshu Pota](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/associate-professor-hemanshu-pota)  I am also an external researcher of [Khalifa University, C2PS](https://www.ku.ac.ae/c2ps) advised by [Prof. Ernesto Damiani ](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/ernesto-damiani) and [Dr. Chan Yeob Yeun](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/chan-yeob-yeun). I am now trying to find opportunities to continue my career as a Ph.D. student. My research interests include smart grids, cyber-physical systems, edge computing, federated learning and explainable AI (XAI).

I graduated from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering. During my final year of my bachelor's, I studied at the [National University of Singapore Suzhou Institute](http://en.nusri.cn/) as an exchange student. And I finished my Final Year of Project advised by [Dr. Peter C. Y. Chen](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/chen-chao-yu-peter/) there.

I graduated from [Khalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae/) with a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. My advisors are [Prof. Ernesto Damiani](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/prof-ernesto-damiani), [Dr. Chan Yeob Yeun](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/dr-chan-yeob-yeun), and [Dr. Fatma Taher](https://www.zu.ac.ae/main/en/colleges/colleges/__college_of_technological_innovation/faculty_and_staff/_profiles/Fatma_Taher.aspx) at [Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS)](https://www.ku.ac.ae/c2ps).
