# üî• About me

Welcome to my personal page! 

My name is Zhibo Zhang (Âº†ÂøóÂçö), a graduate master student of [Kalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae/), [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.ku.ac.ae/people-types/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/), majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I also work in this department as a research and teaching assistant with a full scholarship. Expecting to graduate in 2023.06 with a master‚Äôs degree, I am now trying to find opportunities to continue my career as a Ph.D. student. My research interests include bioinformatics, cyber-physical systems, edge computing, federated learning and explainable AI (XAI).

I graduated from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://en.nwpu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering with honor. During my final year of my bachelor, I studied at the [National University of Singapore Suzhou Institute](http://en.nusri.cn/) as an exchange student. And I finished my Final Year of Project advised by [Dr. Peter C. Y. Chen](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/me/staff/chen-chao-yu-peter/) there.

I am now doing research under the guidance of [Prof. Ernesto Damiani](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/prof-ernesto-damiani), [Dr. Chan Yeob Yeun](https://www.ku.ac.ae/academics/college-of-engineering/department/department-of-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/people/dr-chan-yeob-yeun), [Dr. Hussam Al Hamadi](https://www.ku.ac.ae/college-people/dr-hussam-al-hammadi), and [Dr. Fatma Taher](https://www.zu.ac.ae/main/en/colleges/colleges/__college_of_technological_innovation/faculty_and_staff/_profiles/Fatma_Taher.aspx) at [Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS)](https://www.ku.ac.ae/c2ps). I am now working in areas about developing secure cyber-physical systems using explainable AI.
